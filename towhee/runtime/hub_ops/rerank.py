    The Rerank operator is used to reorder the list of relevant documents for a query.
    It uses the `MS MARCO <https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html#ms-marco>`_
    `Cross-Encoders <https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html#ms-marco>`

    device: str = None, max_length=512, checkpoint_path=None):
        model_name(`str`):
            The model name of CrossEncoder, you can set it according to the
            `Model List <https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained-models/ce-msmarco.html#models-performance>`_.

            The threshold for filtering with score
        device(`str`):
            Device id: cpu/cuda:{GPUID}, if not set, will try to find an available GPU device.
        max_length(`int`):
            Model max sequence length.
        checkpoint_path(`str`):
            You can use local model weights to initialize the operator, otherwise download the default weights from
