title: Image embedding pipelines
---

Image embedding pipelines are used for reduction the dimensionality of the input image processed by general neural networks, including deep neural networks and transformers. They are important for imagesâ€™ classification related applications, because these correspond to a huge dimension data (e.g. a 20 megapixel camera picture with 3 RGB layers means 60 millions of integers as the total info stored in the image).

### Pipelines

These are the pipelines containing pre-trained ResNet models implemented based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf):

**[image-embedding-resnet101](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-resnet101)**

These are the pipelines containing pre-trained EfficientNet models implemented based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf):

**[image-embedding-efficientnetb5](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-efficientnetb5)**

**[image-embedding-efficientnetb7](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-efficientnetb7)**

These are the pipelines containing pre-trained ViT (vision transformer) implemented based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf):

**[image-embedding-vitlarge](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-vitlarge)**

These are the pipelines containing pre-trained Swin Transformers implemented based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030v1.pdf):

**[image-embedding-swinbase](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-swinbase)**

**[image-embedding-swinlarge](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-swinlarge)**

Each pipeline mentioned above employs a single model. In contrast, an ensemble combines multiple models to generate a better embedding, at the cost of higher resource consumption. Towhee offers image embedding pipelines based on emsembles:

### Pipeline family

All the pipelines mentioned above belong to `image-embedding-pipeline family`. Pipeline members of the family follow [this interface](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-pipeline-template).
