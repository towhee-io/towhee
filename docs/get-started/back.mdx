### Launch terminal

To try Towhee in your browser, please click

### Running your first pipeline

This section assumes that you've already gone through the [installation process](get-started/install).

In this guide, we'll introduce Towhee pipelines as well as get started generating embedding vectors using Towhee.

```python
>>> from towhee import pipeline
>>> embedding_pipeline = pipeline('image-embedding')  # instantiate the pipeline
>>> output = embedding_pipeline('towhee_logo.png')  # run an image path through the pipeline
```

And that's it! The embedding vector for the corresponding input image (`towhee_logo.png`) is stored in the `output` variable.

```python
>>> print(output)  # print the output embedding vector
```

Note that the default model used by `image-embedding` is `Resnet50` (you can find the corresponding mapping for default pipelines [here](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee/blob/main/towhee/__init__.py#L25)). The default repository for this pipeline is located on the [Towhee hub](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/image-embedding-resnet50); following the link will take you to a README page describing the pipeline, the model(s) used, and a simple diagram explaining how data flows through the pipeline.

We can also try a different image embedding pipeline instead of the default one. Towhee provides a way to directly call a pipeline repository on the Towhee hub:

```python
>>> embedding_pipeline = pipeline('image-embedding-resnet101')
```

This automatically loads the pipeline located at `towhee/image-embedding-resnet101` on the Towhee hub.

### Try more pipelines

A summary of image embedding pipelines can be found at [here](pipelines/image-embedding). In addition, it is highly-recommended to browse the [hub](https://towhee.io/pipelines?limit=30&page=1) for more interesting pipelines.
