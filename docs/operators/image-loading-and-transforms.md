# Image loading and image transforms (PyOperator)

Image must be preprocessed before feeding to following operators. Possible preprocessing includes resizing, normalization and so on. Such preprocessing is also called transforms in convention.

Towhee suggests wrapping transforms in an operator.

See towhee's image transform [operators](https://hub.towhee.io/towhee/transform-image) in hub.
